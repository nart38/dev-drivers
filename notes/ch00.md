# My Journey to Become a Dev (Preferably Without Learning Webdev) Volume 0x00: Writing a Driver

## A Little Bit of Background for Those Who Care

As an unemployed guy in his mid-twenties without proper academic or vocational education, since the day I installed my first Minecraft mod more than 10 years ago, I have always felt like I was meant to be a computer scientist.

I understood computers better than I understood humans. Obtaining new knowledge, understanding new concepts, and solving problems always gave me great joy. Nowadays, joy is one of those luxuries that I don't possess, and my goal is to change that.

My plan is to do projects and share them openly on the magical place called the internet. If I grind enough publicly, hopefully, something magical (when I say something magical, I mean something related to social skills and networking; I really don't have a grasp on them) will happen, and I will find my first internship as a developer. (Hopefully without going through the "Here's how you can land a software developer job in 3 months by learning CSS, HTML, and JS" route. I don't know why, but web development doesn't give me joy.)

## Goal of The Project

The end goal of the project is writing a character device driver similar to `/dev/zero` that outputs the Fibonacci sequence instead of zero. The catch is I will not write this device just for Linux but also for FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

My plan is to read the LDD3 book chapter by chapter alongside some other resources, take some notes, write some code, and share it here. When learning new stuff, I always find myself in a situation where I act like I'm teaching that stuff to some imaginary people. For me, it is one of the best ways to learn new stuff. I figured that it would be nice to share the stuff that I learned with the **real people** this time.
