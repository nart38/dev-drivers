# Chapter 2: Building and Running Modules

In this chapter we will write our first hello world module and learn some basic shared code. But we need to set up our development enviroment before.

## Setting Up Your Test System

Since we deaing with kernel and if we break it things may go south very fast, it is wise to **not** use you actual system to test you modules. But because it make things easier, running the kernel you targetting is also good practice.

My solution to that I wil use virtual machines. But you can use containers, chroot enviroments or maybe even a spare laptop that is just a few years younger than you. Pick your poison. What really matter is you have kernel headers and a kernel source tree of the kernel you running. Obtaining kernel source tree may vary distro to distro slightly. So I will not go deep into how to set up which distro. In some distros it maybe necessary to have `linux-headers` package installed. Check out your distro specifick documantation (RTFM people!). Here is my set up:

- Linux: 6.7.1 version of Arch Linux kernel. As far as I know It does not alter any critical stuff. So it should be fine.
- FreeBSD: 14.0 release with patch level 3

## Let's Write Our First Module

### Linux

Here is our hello world module for Linux:

```c
// hello.c example from the LDD3 book.
#include <linux/init.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
MODULE_LICENSE("Dual BSD/GPL");

static int hello_init(void) {
  printk(KERN_ALERT "Hello, world\n");
  return 0;
}

static void hello_exit(void) {
	printk(KERN_ALERT "Goodbye, cruel world\n");
}

module_init(hello_init);
module_exit(hello_exit);
```

We starting with including necessary headers. When you include this headers your lsp might yell at you about it can't find this modules in usual places like `/usr/include`. It is ok, we will tell where to include this headers in `Makefile`. We continue declaring the license of our module with `MODULE_LICENSE()` macro. If we don't do that our code will not compile.

Then we define two functions: `hello_init` will get called when the module loaded, `hello_exit` will get called when the module unloaded. Inside of this functions we call `printk` function.

> The module_init and module_exit lines use special kernel macros to indicate the role of these two functions.

> The printk function is defined in the Linux kernel and made available to modules; it behaves similarly to the standard C library function printf. The kernel needs its own printing function because it runs by itself, without the help of the C library. The module can call printk because, after insmod has loaded it, the module is linked to the kernel and can access the kernelâ€™s public symbols (functions and variables, as detailed in the next section). The string KERN_ALERT is the priority of the message.
> The priority is just a string, such as <1>, which is prepended to the printk format string. Note the lack of a comma after KERN_ALERT; adding a comma there is a common and annoying typo (which, fortunately, is caught by the compiler).

The book explains compiling the module further in the chapter. Until then let's just __steal__ a Makefile from the repo [Examples of LDD3 by martinezjavier](https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3/blob/master/misc-modules/Makefile). Here it is:

```Makefile
ifeq ($(KERNELRELEASE),)
    KERNELDIR ?= /usr/lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build
    PWD := $(shell pwd)

modules:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) M=$(PWD) modules

modules_install:
	$(MAKE) -C $(KERNELDIR) M=$(PWD) modules_install

clean:
	rm -rf *.o *~ core .depend .*.cmd *.ko *.mod.c .tmp_versions *.mod modules.order *.symvers

.PHONY: modules modules_install clean

else
    # called from kernel build system: just declare what our modules are
    obj-m := hello.o
endif
```

Let's compile our hello world module:
```sh
make
```
Output of the command looks like this:
```
make -C /usr/lib/modules/6.7.1-arch1-1/build M=/home/user/git-repos/dev-drivers/linux modules
make[1]: Entering directory '/usr/lib/modules/6.7.1-arch1-1/build'
  CC [M]  /home/user/git-repos/dev-drivers/linux/hello.o
  MODPOST /home/user/git-repos/dev-drivers/linux/Module.symvers
  CC [M]  /home/user/git-repos/dev-drivers/linux/hello.mod.o
  LD [M]  /home/user/git-repos/dev-drivers/linux/hello.ko
  BTF [M] /home/user/git-repos/dev-drivers/linux/hello.ko
make[1]: Leaving directory '/usr/lib/modules/6.7.1-arch1-1/build'
```
Then, as a **root** user, we load and unload our module and display the logs.
```sh
insmod ./hello.ko
rmmod ./hello.ko
dmesg
```
Output of the `dmesg`:
```
...
[ 6790.159821] hello: loading out-of-tree module taints kernel.
[ 6790.159826] hello: module verification failed: signature and/or required key missing - tainting kernel
[ 6790.160081] Hello, world
[ 6796.692759] Goodbye, cruel world
```

### FreeBSD

And here is the code for similarly functioning FreeBSD module:

```c
#include <sys/systm.h>
#include <sys/conf.h>
#include <sys/kernel.h>
#include <sys/module.h>
#include <sys/param.h>
#include <sys/types.h>

static int hello_load(module_t mod, int cmd, void *arg) {
  int err = 0;
  switch (cmd) {
  case MOD_LOAD:
    log(1, "Hello from FreeBSD module.");
    break;
  case MOD_UNLOAD:
    log(1, "Goodbye, Moonman!");
    break;
  default:
    err = EOPNOTSUPP;
    break;
  }
  return err;
}

static moduledata_t hello_mod = {"hello", hello_load, NULL};
DECLARE_MODULE(hello, hello_mod, SI_SUB_KLD, SI_ORDER_ANY);
```

Well that is lots of headers. I belive (but not so sure) `sys/systm.h` header should be above some others. Otherwise code does not compile.

You may notice we did'nt defined two different functions for load and unload situations. We only defined one function. In the function signature we accepting a varaible called `cmd` and switch on that. Kernel will tell us if our module getting loaded or unloaded via this `cmd` argument.

We using `log(9)` this time instead of `printk` to wirte our messeage to logs.

Then we declare a struct contains the name of our module, event handler and a void pointer for extra data which we did'nt use. Then we use `DECLARE_MOUDLE(9)` macro to declare our module. First argument is the name of the moduel, second is data of the module that we defined, subsystem interface and the initialization order.

Makefile of our FreeBSD module is much simpler:

```Makefile
SRCS=hello.c		    # Source files of our module
KMOD=hello		    # Name of our module

.include <bsd.kmod.mk>	    # We include kernel module makefile
```

Compile it with `make`, load with `kldload ./hello.ko`, unload with `kldunload ./hello.ko`. And finally print the logs with `dmesg`:
```
...
Hello from FreeBSD module.
Goodbye, Moonman!
```
